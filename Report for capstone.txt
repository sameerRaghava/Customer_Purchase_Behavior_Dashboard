The order-level analysis investigates the overall performance of Freshco Hypermarket's order management system. By analyzing key metrics like order completion rates, order distribution across different areas and time slots, product discounts, and customer order ratings, this report identifies trends and areas for improvement.

2. Key Metrics for Order Level Analysis
Order Completion Rate
The completion rate measures the percentage of orders that were successfully fulfilled versus those that were cancelled.
The analysis will explore completion rates at different levels:
Area Level
Time Slot Level (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
Order Distribution
This metric assesses how orders are distributed across various areas and time slots to understand customer preferences and demand trends.
Discount as a Percentage of Product Amount
The analysis focuses on evaluating how discounts offered as a percentage of the product amount vary across:
Delivery Area
Time Slot
Order Rating Distribution
Customer feedback in the form of order ratings helps evaluate the quality of service.
The analysis includes understanding how ratings are distributed across areas and slots.

3. Analysis Details
A. Order Completion Rate
By Area
Areas like HSR Layout and Koramangala have the highest completion rates, consistently above 95%. This could be due to the store's proximity, enabling faster delivery and lower cancellation rates.
In contrast, areas such as Banashankari and Bannerghatta show relatively lower completion rates, with higher instances of cancelled orders. This might be attributed to longer delivery distances, traffic issues, or availability of delivery personnel.

By Time Slot
Morning and Afternoon slots exhibit higher completion rates (above 90%), suggesting that these times are more favorable for both customers and delivery partners.
Late Night slots have the lowest completion rates, with cancellations occurring more frequently due to limited delivery resources or customer availability.

B. Order Distribution
By Area
Areas like HSR Layout and BTM Layout contribute to the highest number of orders, accounting for more than 40% of total orders. These areas likely represent core markets for Freshco Hypermarket.
Whitefield and Electronic City, although further away, still show significant order volumes, likely due to large residential populations.

By Time Slot
The Evening slot (5 PM to 9 PM) sees the highest order volume, representing peak shopping hours. This is consistent across most areas.
Late Night slots have the lowest order count, as expected, given that fewer customers place orders after 9 PM.

C. Discount as a Percentage of Product Amount
By Area
The analysis reveals that certain areas, like Akshaya Nagar and Arekere, consistently receive higher discounts (12%-16% on average). This could be part of targeted promotional campaigns aimed at increasing orders in those areas.
In areas like Bannerghatta and Basavanagudi, the percentage of discount fluctuates, indicating that promotional strategies vary significantly depending on the product type and customer behavior in those areas.

By Time Slot
The Afternoon slot shows the highest average discount percentages, potentially due to mid-day promotions or reduced customer demand at these times.
Discounts during Morning slots are relatively low, suggesting that customers placing orders in the morning may be less price-sensitive, or there are fewer promotions available during these times.

D. Order Rating Distribution
By Area
Koramangala and HSR Layout have the highest average customer ratings, with most orders receiving 4 or 5 stars. This indicates a positive delivery and product experience in these key areas.
Bannerghatta and Banashankari have lower average ratings, with more instances of 3-star or lower ratings. This could be tied to delivery delays or product availability issues in these areas.

By Time Slot
Morning and Afternoon slots consistently receive the highest average ratings. This aligns with their higher completion rates and faster delivery times.
Late Night slots have the lowest ratings, likely due to slower deliveries and higher cancellation rates.

4. Key Insights
Completion Rates
The completion rates in high-demand areas such as HSR Layout and Koramangala are consistently high, reflecting a well-functioning delivery system in these regions.
However, completion rates in more distant areas like Banashankari could be improved by increasing delivery resources or adjusting delivery times to meet customer expectations.

Discount Strategies
Areas like Akshaya Nagar and Arekere are receiving significant discounts, suggesting targeted promotions that are working to drive higher order volumes in these regions. Continuation of such campaigns in low-demand areas may help balance order distribution.
Afternoon slots show the highest discount percentage, indicating that promotions during off-peak hours may be effective in generating orders. This strategy could be further optimized by offering targeted promotions in specific low-demand areas during those slots.
Customer Satisfaction

High customer ratings in areas like Koramangala and HSR Layout indicate that these regions are crucial to maintaining Freshco's strong reputation. Expanding similar operational strategies to areas with lower ratings could help improve customer satisfaction.
Late Night slots show lower completion rates and customer ratings. Additional delivery resources or limited-time incentives for late-night shoppers could help address these issues.

5. Recommendations
Optimize Resource Allocation for Distant Areas
Invest more delivery resources in areas like Bannerghatta and Banashankari to boost completion rates and customer satisfaction.

Expand Targeted Promotions
Continue offering afternoon slot discounts in low-demand areas. This could help redistribute order volumes and reduce peak-time pressure on delivery operations.

Improve Late-Night Delivery Service
To address the lower completion rates and ratings during late-night slots, consider offering special incentives, such as free delivery or guaranteed faster delivery for late-night orders.

Enhance Customer Experience in Low-Rating Areas
Areas like Banashankari and Bannerghatta need attention regarding both product availability and delivery times to increase customer satisfaction ratings. Streamlining processes in these regions could improve overall customer perception.

6. Conclusion
This order-level analysis highlights both strengths and opportunities within Freshco Hypermarket's home delivery system. By focusing on enhancing operations in lower-performing areas and time slots, Freshco can further optimize its delivery processes and boost customer satisfaction. Addressing the issues of late-night delivery and expanding targeted promotions are critical to balancing order distribution and maintaining high service quality.

3. Analysis Details
A. Customer Acquisition Source
Distribution of Customers by Source
Social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook are leading acquisition sources, accounting for a large share of Freshcoâ€™s customer base.
Offline campaigns and organic (direct) sources also contribute significantly, indicating strong word-of-mouth and traditional advertising efforts.
Platforms like Snapchat and Google show lower acquisition numbers, which suggests these channels may require further optimization or additional investment.
Effectiveness of Acquisition Sources
Customers acquired through Instagram show higher levels of engagement, with an above-average order frequency and LTV. This suggests that Instagram marketing campaigns are effectively targeting high-value customers.
Facebook customers display moderate engagement, but there is potential to increase order frequency through targeted promotions and personalized campaigns.

B. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
LTV by Acquisition Source
Customers from Instagram exhibit the highest average LTV, making it a key platform for high-revenue customers. The success of Instagram campaigns can be attributed to well-targeted ads and frequent engagement with potential customers.
Organic (direct) customers show a consistently strong LTV, which suggests that Freshcoâ€™s brand reputation and loyalty are significant drivers of long-term customer value.
Offline Campaigns and Snapchat sources show lower LTVs, meaning that customers from these channels either spend less or are less engaged over time.
LTV by Customer Segment
High-value customers, as measured by LTV, are more likely to come from younger demographics, especially those active on Instagram. This indicates that targeting younger customers through social media is a viable strategy for long-term revenue growth.
C. Order Frequency
Order Frequency by Acquisition Source
Instagram and Organic channels show the highest order frequency, with customers placing an average of 6-7 orders per year.
Offline Campaigns and Snapchat customers exhibit lower order frequency, averaging 2-3 orders annually, suggesting that these channels may require more follow-up strategies such as loyalty programs or personalized marketing to increase engagement.
Order Frequency by Customer Segment
Younger customers, especially those from social media channels like Instagram and Snapchat, tend to place orders more frequently. However, customers acquired through Offline Campaigns tend to place fewer orders, indicating that while the campaigns may succeed in bringing in new customers, further efforts are needed to retain and engage them.
D. Customer Satisfaction (Ratings)
Ratings by Acquisition Source
Customers from Facebook and Instagram report the highest satisfaction levels, consistently giving orders an average rating of 4.5 or above. This indicates strong customer experiences driven by effective marketing and fulfillment.
Offline Campaign customers show slightly lower satisfaction levels (average rating of 3.8), which could point to a need for improved customer onboarding and post-order experience for these customers.
Ratings by Customer Segment
Organic customers show strong loyalty and high ratings, indicating their satisfaction with Freshcoâ€™s services. This suggests that returning customers are generally happy with their experience.
New customers acquired from Offline Campaigns and Snapchat have slightly lower average ratings, possibly due to initial onboarding issues or unmet expectations.

4. Key Insights
Strong Performance of Social Media Channels
Instagram stands out as the top acquisition channel in terms of customer LTV and order frequency, making it a key platform for Freshcoâ€™s growth strategy.
Facebook also drives customer acquisition but may benefit from targeted re-engagement campaigns to boost order frequency and LTV.
Offline Campaigns Need Optimization
While Offline Campaigns bring in a decent share of customers, they exhibit lower engagement (LTV and order frequency). Freshco should consider implementing retention strategies such as personalized offers or loyalty rewards to improve the performance of this channel.
Opportunities to Improve Customer Satisfaction
Offline Campaign and Snapchat customers report lower satisfaction ratings, suggesting an opportunity to enhance customer experience through better onboarding, order fulfillment, or follow-up communication.
Consistently high ratings from Organic and Facebook customers indicate strong customer loyalty, which can be leveraged to encourage referrals or repeat purchases.
High Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) from Instagram and Organic Channels
The Instagram and Organic customer segments show the highest LTV. Freshco should continue investing in social media and brand-building efforts, as these channels are bringing in customers with higher long-term revenue potential.

5. Recommendations
Leverage Instagram for High LTV Customers
Given the strong performance of Instagram, Freshco should allocate more resources to this channel, including influencer marketing, targeted ads, and engagement initiatives like giveaways or contests. This will help continue attracting high-value customers.
Improve Retention for Offline Campaign Customers
To maximize the effectiveness of Offline Campaigns, Freshco should develop follow-up strategies, such as:
Personalized discounts after the first purchase.
Loyalty rewards to encourage repeat orders.
Regular email communication to keep customers engaged post-acquisition.
Boost Customer Experience for Lower-Rated Segments
Focus on enhancing the post-purchase experience for Snapchat and Offline Campaign customers. Addressing delivery issues, product availability, or other pain points can help raise satisfaction levels and encourage repeat business.
Enhance Customer Engagement Programs
Implement customer loyalty programs that offer rewards for frequent orders. This could further increase the order frequency for customers acquired through social media channels and organic sources.

6. Conclusion
This Customer Level Analysis reveals critical insights into Freshco Hypermarket's customer base. With Instagram and Organic channels driving the highest value in terms of lifetime customer revenue and engagement, these platforms should remain key focuses for growth. While Offline Campaigns and Snapchat bring in a lower LTV and satisfaction, there are clear opportunities to improve through targeted follow-up strategies and enhanced customer experience efforts. By implementing these recommendations, Freshco can boost customer retention, satisfaction, and overall revenue.

Geographical Challenges
Certain delivery areas like Bannerghatta and Whitefield face logistical challenges that reduce the completion rate. To address this, Freshco could explore partnering with local delivery partners or improving route planning.
Night-Time Operations Require Attention
The lower completion rate during Night slots indicates challenges such as long delivery times and lower staffing levels. Freshco should consider optimizing resources for night-time deliveries or offering incentives for customers to choose earlier delivery slots.
Varying Completion Rates by Acquisition Source

Further nurturing through follow-up communication or setting clear expectations may help improve completion rates for these segments.
Cancellation Patterns
Late-night cancellations are a recurring issue, possibly due to extended delivery times. Addressing operational delays and ensuring clear communication with customers about expected delivery times could reduce the number of cancellations.

5. Recommendations
Improve Night-Time Operations
To enhance the completion rate for Night slots, Freshco should consider:
Increasing staffing or adding delivery partners for late-night orders.
Offering faster delivery options or time-specific incentives to encourage customers to place orders in more manageable slots.
Focus on Low-Completion Areas
For areas with lower completion rates like Whitefield and Bannerghatta, Freshco should:
Improve route optimization and delivery planning.
Consider localized campaigns to build stronger engagement and reduce cancellations.
Explore partnerships with local delivery services for these harder-to-reach areas.
Optimize Acquisition Channels
Freshco should continue focusing on Instagram and Organic channels, as customers acquired from these sources have high engagement and completion rates.
For channels with lower completion rates like Offline Campaigns and Snapchat, Freshco should:
Implement strategies to better engage these customers post-acquisition, such as follow-up communication, targeted offers, or education about the delivery process.
Monitor Delivery Times
